abstract: "Many computer vision problems can be cast into optimization problems over discrete graphical models also known as Markov or
conditional random fields. Standard methods are able to solve those problems quite efficiently. However, problems with huge label spaces and or
higher-order structure remain challenging or intractable even for approximate methods.
We reconsider the work of Lempitsky et al. 2010 on fusion moves
and apply it to general discrete graphical models. We propose two alternatives for calculating fusion moves that outperform the standard in
several applications. Our generic software framework allows us to easily
use different proposal generators which spans a large class of inference
algorithms and thus makes exhaustive evaluation feasible.
Because these fusion algorithms can be applied to models with huge
label spaces and higher-order terms, they might stimulate and support
research of such models which may have not been possible so far due to
the lack of adequate inference methods."
