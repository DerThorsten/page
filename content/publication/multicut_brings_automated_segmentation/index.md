abstract: "The connectomics community is acquiring volumetric
electron microscopy (EM) images of the brain at an unprecedented
rate with the aim of mapping out and understanding in detail the
physical correlates of information processing in animals. Reliable
automatic segmentation is urgently needed for upcoming wholebrain data sets (>100 terabytes (TB) per volume). Manual analysis,
despite impressive progress in collaborative annotation1, will not
scale to this massive task. We present an algorithm and software
package to segment such data sets with low error rates. The software
is made available open source in the Supplementary Software and
at online repositories, and we also provide precompil"
