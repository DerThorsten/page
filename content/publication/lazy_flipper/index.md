abstract: "We propose a novel graphical model for probabilistic image segmentation that contributes both to aspects of perceptual grouping in connection with image segmentation, and
to globally optimal inference with higher-order graphical
models. We represent image partitions in terms of cellular
complexes in order to make the duality between connected
regions and their contours explicit. This allows us to formulate a graphical model with higher-order factors that represent the requirement that all contours must be closed. The
model induces a probability measure on the space of all partitions, concentrated on perceptually meaningful segmentations. We give a complete polyhedral characterization of the
resulting global inference problem in terms of the multicut
polytope and efficiently compute global optima by a cutting
plane method. Competitive results for the Berkeley segmentation benchmark confirm the consistency of our approach."
