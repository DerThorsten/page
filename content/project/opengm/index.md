OpenGM is a C++ template library for discrete factor graph models and distributive operations on these models. 
I used to work a lot on OpenGM when I was an undergrad bachelor student.
Currently OpenGM in unmaintained.
While OpenGM covers a state-of-the-art optimization and inference algorithms beyond message passing, the code is really really messy.
