# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Making their own tiny video games can be a great way for kids to learn programming in a playful matter. While Jupyter is widely used as a scientific and educational tool, Jupyter is seldom used as a platform for game development. In this blog post, we show how Jupyter can be used to develop tiny games based on Box2D. While Jupyter is language agnostic and kernels exist for many programming languages, we will focus on the Python programming language in this blog post.
