Existing methods, such as agglomerative or correlation clustering, rely solely on boundary evidence and have problems where such an evidence is lacking (e.g., incomplete staining) or ambiguous (e.g., co-located cell and mitochondria membranes). We investigate if these difficulties can be overcome by means of sparse region appearance cues that differentiate between pre- and postsynaptic neuron segments in mammalian neural tissue. We combine these cues with the traditional boundary evidence in the asymmetric multiway cut (AMWC) model, which simultaneously solves the partitioning and the semantic region labeling problems. We show that AMWC problems over superpixel graphs can be solved to global optimality with a cutting plane approach, and that the introduction of semantic class priors leads to significantly better segmentations.","tags":[],"title":"Neuron segmentation with high-level biological priors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Thorsten Beier","Constantin Pape","Nasim Rahaman","Timo Prange","Stuart Berg","Davi D.

To this end we define fusion moves for the correlation clustering problem. Our algorithm iteratively fuses the current and a proposed partitioning which monotonously improves the partitioning and maintains a valid partitioning at all times. Furthermore, it scales to larger datasets, gives near optimal solutions, and at the same time shows a good anytime performance.","tags":[],"title":"Fusion moves for correlation clustering","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Nifty is a C++ library for:\ngraph based image processing multicut objective lifted multicut objective agglomerative clustering I implemented nifty when I did my PhD since my research was focused on the topics above.\n","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"e61d622cbd2ee38349830b5e14a78ba4","permalink":"https://derthorsten.github.io/page/project/nifty/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/page/project/nifty/","section":"project","summary":"A C++ / Python library for graph based image processing, solving the multicut and lifted multicut objective, and agglomerative clustering.","tags":["Discrete Optimization","Multicut","Lifted Multicut","Agglomerative Clustering","C++"],"title":"nifty","type":"project"},{"authors":["Julian Yarkony","Dr. Thorsten Beier","Pierre Baldi","Fred A Hamprecht"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1411084800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1411084800,"objectID":"e6498836c67edde85cd555bff059d01f","permalink":"https://derthorsten.github.io/page/publication/parallel_multicut/","publishdate":"2014-09-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/page/publication/parallel_multicut/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a new outer relaxation of the multicut polytope, along with a dual decomposition approach for correlation clustering and multicut segmentation, for general graphs.

Standard methods are able to solve those problems quite efficiently. However, problems with huge label spaces and or higher-order structure remain challenging or intractable even for approximate methods. We reconsider the work of Lempitsky et al. 2010 on fusion moves and apply it to general discrete graphical models. We propose two alternatives for calculating fusion moves that outperform the standard in several applications. Our generic software framework allows us to easily use different proposal generators which spans a large class of inference algorithms and thus makes exhaustive evaluation feasible. Because these fusion algorithms can be applied to models with huge label spaces and higher-order terms, they might stimulate and support research of such models which may have not been possible so far due to the lack of adequate inference methods.","tags":[],"title":"MAP-inference on large scale higher-order discrete graphical models by fusion moves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Thorsten Beier","Thorben Kroeger","Jorg H.

Starting from a superpixel segmentation, an edge-weighted region adjacency graph is constructed. Amongst all segmentations of the graph, the one which best conforms to the given image evidence, as measured by the sum of cut edge weights, is chosen. Since this problem is NP-hard, we propose a new approximate solver based on the move-making paradigm: first, the graph is recursively partitioned into small regions (cut phase). Then, for any two adjacent regions, we consider alternative cuts of these two regions defining possible moves (glue \u0026 cut phase). For planar problems, the optimal move can be found, whereas for non-planar problems, efficient approximations exist. We evaluate our algorithm on published and new benchmark datasets, which we make available here. The proposed algorithm finds segmentations that, as measured by a loss function, are as close to the ground-truth as the global optimum found by exact solvers. It does so significantly faster then existing approximate methods, which is important for large-scale problems.","tags":[],"title":"Cut, glue \u0026 cut: A fast, approximate solver for multicut partitioning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bjoern Andres","Jorg H.
